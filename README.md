# JHU_DataScience_Course3_Project
## Getting and Cleaning final project
This repository includes:
1. A readme file
2. One R script run_analysis.R that does the following:
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
    <li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
    <li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.</li>
    <li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.</li>
    <li>From the data set in step d, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
  </ol>
3. An output file resulted from the R script.
